# This_Week_In_Student_Life
This code repository is for an ongoing project. Its purpose is to make an aspect of my job at Florida Tech more efficient.

This aspect is writing a weekly email that lists all events occurring on our campus. Previously, this process would take 3-4 hours, depending on how many events were scheduled for the week. I have taken this process down to less than 1 minute with the use of this program.

Possible Features:
- Option to save the password for quicker sign-in
- Window to choose what clubs to exclude
- Pull photos and choose some at random to add
